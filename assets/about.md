The **XR Rhythms Player** is here to help you on your journey with protest samba fusion. *(Scroll down for the tunes list!)*

It absolutely isn’t telling you the “right way” to play: it’s a resource for learning and practising the tunes and breaks that XR Rhythms UK bands tend to play when we’re all together, prioritising what’s commonest and most accessible for the greatest number of players and bands.

Individual bands can and will do their own thing and that’s great – that’s where real folk traditions come from, after all. More advanced bands can look at the more involved breaks and tunes, while more advanced players can treat the material here as an outline. (We’ve got a few of the more established fancier parts listed as alternatives, though again, that’s not the priority.)

The Core Tunes and Core Breaks are more than enough for a band to play with: they make up 80%+ of what we do when we’re together. We don’t know any XR bands that play absolutely everything on here! Instead, we tend to explore combining and layering our material.

Have fun, wear earplugs and see you in the streets!
