One of the funkiest tunes we’ve got! See **Controversies** below, though, for playing it at national events.

**Sign:** pull two prison bars apart in front of your face

## Background

**Name:** Angela Davis is an African American activist who experienced great oppression as a university professor due to her political views and involvement in the Black liberation, communist and radical feminist movements. She became a major figure of the prison abolition movement after being imprisoned for a murder that she did not commit. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis), see also the documentary “Free Angela & All Political Prisoners”)

**Musical background:** Break 1 and the low surdo part sound like “Sex Machine” by James Brown.  

RoR bands, who tend to have proper samba surdos, usually play the low surdo part with a whippy stick in one hand. As our bands tend to use converted drum kit drums, clicking on the rim or the wooden body with your usual beaters sounds better.

**Sign:** The sign represents prison bars, because Angela Davis is a major figure in prison abolition.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000. The name used to be “James Brown” and the sign depicted an afro. The tune was renamed because of domestic violence and rape accusations against James Brown, and Angela Davis was chosen because she fit the tune sign. Later the tune sign was changed because yikes.

RoR considers both the old tune sign itself and the fact that Angela Davis was chosen because of her afro as racist, and some RoR members from the Baltic States have raised concerns as she was a member of the Communist Party and actively collaborated with the oppressive regime of the Soviet Union.

## Controversies

As it was originally based on the music of a rapist, some XR bands don’t play this tune (in common with some in the RoR network).

At national events we tend not to play it while marching unless we’re sure no-one objects. While standing still, we sign a Silence 4x before changing to it in case anyone wants to leave.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid Surdo:** easy to remember, but hard to play it without being too fast or slow
* **High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tam:** easy
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** consists of a pickup followed by a bar of eighth notes.
* **Break 2** is between surdos and everyone else, ending with the pattern of Break 1.
* **Break 3** is a loop played by everyone except snares (who just continue their normal part) and also ends with the pattern of Break 1 each time.
