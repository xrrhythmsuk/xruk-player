**Sign:** Fingers past your eyes

## Background

**Name:** A new XR Rhythms tune “borrowed” rather more directly than the others.

**Musical background:** Sounds like any number of Olodum songs ([example](https://youtu.be/A3o30YJiWsc)), but specifically taken from [this song](https://youtu.be/0Pq8vOVbvzs) by the Colombian band Aainjaa.

The difficulty mostly comes from us feeling the song as double time, so breaks will go twice as fast as usual:

instead of *1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and*, it’s *1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4*

A helpful tip is to start the snares off first to get everyone in time.

**Sign:** like a cartoon burglar mask

**History:** Introduced to XR Rhythms in 2021. It was our first non-RoR tune.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid/High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tam:** hard (the rhythm is different from everyone else)
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is repi-led and tricky to get the timing on, especially if you play the tune fast. Start slow and let it groove!  
  You can also keep the snares going throughout like the original Aainjaa version to help with the timing
* The **2/4 break** *(cross arms, 2 fingers on one hand, 4 on the other)* is a short one that works well as an intro or quick bridge
* **Break 3** is a mid-length one based on the tam line _[less common nationally]_
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 hits, 8 hits, Progressive Karla (gets very fast at the end – try having the agogôs play in the gap!), Whistle break (played straight rather than swung)
