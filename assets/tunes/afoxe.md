That driving low surdo part works very well for backing chants (along with Samba Reggae) and repis love the long call break!  
Just make sure the tams and agogôs aren't about to stage a mutiny...

**Name:** Usually pronounced “AFF-uh-shay” or “a-FOSH-ay” by our English-speaking bands

**Sign:** Shaving your armpit

## Background

**Name:** Afoxé can refer to a rhythm from Brazilian carnaval, a type of rattle from Brazilian music, or a dance and music formation in the Carnaval. All three meanings developed out of Candomblé, a creole religion which evolved through slaves from West Africa who were forcefully brought to South America by white slave traders. The enslaved Black people in Brazil passed on the religious rites through generations. Candomblé is still practised by some Afro-Brazilians today ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afox%C3%AA)).

**Musical background:** The tune sounds very similar to some Afoxé rhythms from Brazil ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/WCah-JgDktA?t=301)).

**Sign:** The sign comes from the English pronunciation of the name resembling “aftershave” or “had-a-shave”.

**History:** Part of the second round of tunes that was introduced by Barking Bateria in 2004/2005.

The alt repi part is taken from [Barking Bateria Afoxé](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/afoxe-in-to-nova-balanca#t=1:22).


Many in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune. However, after consulting with musicians and other people with knowledge of samba, including people from Brazil, the XR Rhythms network has kept playing the samba-derived tunes [while making it clearer that we aren’t samba](https://xrrhythms.uk/about).


There is also criticism of the sign, since it ridicules the spiritual meaning of the rhythm and shaving armpits is a loaded topic in our patriarchal society.


## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** easy
* **Mid/High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** hard (medium two-stick alt part available)
* **Snare:** hard
* **Tam:** medium (easy to mix up with Custard, tiring)
* **Agogô:** medium (easy to mix up with Custard)

## Breaks

* [**Break 1**](/#/listen/Afoxe/Break%201) is between surdos and everyone else
* **[Breaks 2](/#/listen/Afoxe/Break%202) and [3](/#/listen/Afoxe/Break%203)** are alternate surdo lines while [everyone else](/#/listen/Afoxe/Tune%20Break%202) [carries on](/#/listen/Afoxe/Tune%20Break%203) (3 is the same rhythm as 1) _\[less common nationally\]_
* The **Call break**, led by repis and with a [long](/#/listen/Afoxe/Long%20call) and a [short](/#/listen/Afoxe/Short%20call) version
* **General breaks** that work well: [Tam Line](/#/listen/Afoxe/Tam%20Line), [Wolf Break](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Wolf%20Break)
