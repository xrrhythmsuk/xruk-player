This is one of our core tunes. Together with Custard, it’s our tune that sounds most like “real” samba.

Like real samba, many of the breaks are more complicated, especially compared to our other tunes. Don’t feel like you have to learn them all!

Since practically every samba/samba-fusion band can play a version of samba reggae, it’s a good tune to play together with non-XR/RoR bands.

## Background

**Name:** Samba Reggae is the original afro bloc rhythm, a mix of samba and reggae created by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Samba reggae is a sub-genre of samba that arose in the context of Afro-Brazilians fighting for their right to play samba music and partake in Carnival parades in the late 1960s. At that time only white people were allowed to play in the parades for Carnival and in the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro. Samba reggae is a samba style that developed because Black people in Brazil wanted one to call their own, incorporating influences from the Black diaspora such as reggae and funk. The music of the afro blocos aimed to recreate and strengthen the Afro-Brazilian community. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_reggae))

In “real” samba, ‘samba reggae’ is a specific sub-genre in terms of the rhythm and also what instruments are used and how they are played which is different from other kinds of samba. For example the repi, which otherwise is mostly worn quite high and played with a short wooden stick and the hand, is worn low and played with two long plastic rods.

**Musical background:** The tune is a mix of Barking Bateria Samba Reggae 1 and 3. It has the mid surdo on beats 1 and 3 and the low on 2 and 4 (mid-low-mid-low low), while many samba bands play it low-mid-low-mid mid. The repi and snare parts used to be swapped too.  

As XR bands rarely have mids, our lows often play the first and third beats as a silent stroke (hit with your hand muffling) to replace them.

Many in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune as it sounds like real samba reggae, a genre developed and used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil.

**Sign:** Changed at the first 2022 camp from “smoking a joint” because just wow.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000.  
The Whistle break comes from the RoR tune Sheffield Samba Reggae.  
The Circle break is adapted from the RoR Samba Reggae call break.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repinique**: medium
* **Snare**: hard (medium starter part available)
* **Tam**: easy 
* **Agogô**: medium (easy starter part available)

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is a longer break led by repis and snares. It sounds great once you’ve got it!
* **Break 2** is a short repi-led break based on the clave rhythm (like most of our Samba Reggae breaks). It’s a good break to start with when you’re learning them, and you can get different instruments to lead it. (Sign Break 2 – agogô for agogôs to lead, for instance, or Break 2 – everyone to make it into a nice unison break.)
* The **Whistle break** *(point at whistle with both hands, whistle in with surdo part twice)* is a fun double-time swing break you can use anywhere. Try using a clave or two to get out of it _\[less common nationally\]_
* **Break 3** is a longer surdo-led break _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* The **Circle break** *(two claves coming together to make an ‘O’)* is a medium-length break with a repi call and then claves. One classic use is to slow the band down and swing to turn it from Samba Reggae into Reggae Samba (and then speed up afterwards). You can use it anywhere, particularly for tunes without a call break. Try replacing the claves with a short break from the tune! _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* The **SOS break** *(rub a ball between hands moving side to side)* has the same rhythm as the first part of the circle break and is a shorter surdo-led break. It also has a quirk where repis keep playing their SOS part back in the main part until the next SOS break _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: Clave, Knock on the Door
