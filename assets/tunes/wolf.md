A driving, howling tune introduced at summer camp 2023. Still recent but goes down a storm!  
It pairs well with [Stolen](/#/listen/Stolen) but usually isn’t whistled double time.

**Sign:** Both hands do a V shape, meeting in the middle to make a W


## Background

**Name:** A wolf is a large mammal native to Eurasia and North America and the ancestor of domestic dogs.

**Musical background:** The Wolf Break actually predates this RoR tune, originally being a special break for Afoxé. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** It’s a big W for Wolf. The RoR sign is apparently a big V. *(More info needed.)*

**History:** From the [website of RoR Kraków](https://sambaka.wordpress.com/rytmy/) *(more info needed)*

We’ve adapted it a little for XR bands, mostly by combining the low and mid lines and reworking the breaks.

The alt repi line is based on RoR Wolf Break 1, and Break 2 is based on RoR Wolf Pat 1.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** medium
* **Mid/High Surdo:** hard
* **Repi:** hard (there’s a medium two-stick alt line)
* **Snare:** medium (you can play the buzzes as a normal accent)
* **Tam:** medium (there’s a hard alt line)
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* [**Break 1**](/#/listen/Wolf/Break%201) is a short break based off the end of the Wolf Break
* [**Break 2**](/#/listen/Wolf/Break%202) is an alternate bassline
* **General breaks** that work well: [Wolf Break](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Wolf%20Break) (spoiler alert)
