**Sign:** Both hands do a V shape, meeting in the middle to make a W


## Background

**Name:** A wolf is a large mammal native to Eurasia and North America and the ancestor of domestic dogs.

**Musical background:** The Wolf Break actually predates this RoR tune, originally being a special break for Afoxé. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** It’s... a big W for Wolf? *(More info needed.)*

**History:** From the [website of RoR Kraków](https://sambaka.wordpress.com/rytmy/) *(more info needed)*

We’ve adapted it a little for XR bands, mostly by combining the low and mid lines and making the RoR “pats” into Break 2.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** medium
* **Mid/High Surdo:** hard
* **Repi:** hard 
* **Snare:** medium (you can play the buzzes as a normal accent)
* **Tam:** medium (there’s a hard alt line)
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is a short break based off the end of the Wolf Break
* **Break 2** is an alternate bassline
* **General breaks** that work well: Wolf Break (spoiler alert)
