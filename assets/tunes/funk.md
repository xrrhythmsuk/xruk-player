This is one of our core tunes and often the first one new bands learn.

It doesn’t sound much like funk, which is something of a theme with RoR tunes.

**Sign:** two OK signs above your head looking like funky glasses (or potatoes with roots).

## Background

**Name:** Funk is a style of music that was created in the 1960s by African Americans. It originates from African musical traditions and has also been used heavily in Black liberation movements throughout history. The pioneer of funk is James Brown. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk))

**Musical background:** Probably based on the Brazilian samba reggae interpretation of funk rather than the James Brown version.

**Sign:** Based on the funky glasses that the classic funk bassist Bootsy Collins [used to wear](https://media.npr.org/assets/artslife/arts/2009/10/bootsy-fa-0a236a00a27e682eed7c121e1f0454d4be5adee0-s600-c85.webp).

**History:** Was introduced to the network at least 2008. Barking Bateria played a slightly different version called [“Lego Funk”](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/lego-funk), which is where our starter repi part comes from.   

The sign appears to have evolved from an ‘F’ with thumb and two fingers facing down.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo**: easy
* **Mid/High Surdo and Tam**: easy
* **Repi**: medium (main one-stick and alt two-stick parts), easier starter part available.
* **Snare**: easy
* **Agogô**: easy

## Breaks

* [**Break 1**](/#/listen/Funk/Break%201), a relatively involved break between surdos and everyone else _\[uncommon nationally\]_
* [**Break 2**](/#/listen/Funk/Break%202), where everyone plays one bar of 8s _\[less common nationally\]_
* **General breaks** that work well: [Conga](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Conga), [Little Cat](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Little%20Cat), [Flappy Mouth](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Flappy%20Mouth)
* Some bands use [Squirrel](/#/listen/Squirrel) breaks with Funk instead (signed as e.g. Squirrel – Break 2 – Funk)
