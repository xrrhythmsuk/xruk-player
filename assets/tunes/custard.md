Together with Samba Reggae, this is the tune which sounds most like “real” samba.

**Sign:** making an offering to the sky

## Background

**Name:** From the tam/agogô mnemonic “I’ve got custard in my underpants”, which is... certainly memorable.

**Musical background:** A typical samba reggae-style tune.  
As XR bands rarely have mids, our lows often play the first and third beats as a silent stroke (hit with your hand muffling) to replace them.

**Sign:** used to be a “W” for Welfare State (the former name of the tune), as can be seen in this [video](https://tube.rhythms-of-resistance.org/w/3LnZ6d58J1jd5GNzK1mQqp) by the original RoR London. It changed into the current sign and can also be interpreted as “holding a plate of custard”.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000. Used to be called Welfare State, but was renamed because people didn’t like the state.

Many in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune as it sounds like real samba reggae, a genre developed and used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil.
