This is one of our core tunes and often one of the first ones new bands learn. It helps that everyone plays pretty much the same rhythm.

**Sign:** spiky fingers on your head

## Background

**Name:** A hedgehog is a medium-sized spiky mammal. The name might originally reflect this simpler tune being good for ‘spiky’ (nowadays called ‘spicy’) actions.

**Musical background:** Reportedly the first Barking Bateria tune that doesn’t go back to the London School of Samba. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** The sign depicts the spikes of a hedgehog

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000.  
Not very popular with many RoR bands, who tend to play Ragga instead.

The first two general breaks listed below are the two breaks that RoR Hedgehog has.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo**: easy
* **Mid Surdo**: easy
* **High Surdo**: easy
* **Repi**: easy. There are two parts, one for one stick and one for two sticks that’s a bit busier 
* **Snare**: medium
* **Tam**: easy
* **Agogô**: medium

## Breaks

* We made the only break we had for this song (involving shouting “Act now!” or whatever slogan) into the **A Break** *(forearms in an upside-down V)* for the 2023 camp so it could be used generally
* **General breaks** that work well: A Break, 4 Hits surdos with everyone else carrying on, Kickbacks and Zorro Break from Ragga
