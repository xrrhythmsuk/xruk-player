This is one of our core tunes and often one of the first ones new bands learn. It helps that everyone plays pretty much the same rhythm.

If you’re wondering why we’ve got Break 2 listed here, it’s because RoR Hedgehog Break 1 is effectively surdos doing 4 Hits while everyone else plays main.

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo**: easy
* **Mid Surdo**: easy
* **High Surdo**: easy
* **Repi**: easy. There are two parts, one for one stick and one for two sticks that’s a bit busier 
* **Snare**: medium
* **Tam**: easy
* **Agogô**: medium

## Breaks

* The only break we have for this song (involving shouting “Act now!” or whatever slogan) can be signed as **Break 1 or Break 2** – either way, there’s only one
* **General breaks** that work well: 4 Hits surdos with everyone else carrying on
* Some bands have started using the break as a general break, calling it the **A Break** (*forearms in an upside down V*)
