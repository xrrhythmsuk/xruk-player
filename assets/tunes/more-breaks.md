These are the rest of our general breaks

Once your band has the core tunes and breaks down, learning more general breaks is a great next step

They don’t all have audio here, but they do all get used and are worth knowing, so dig in!

Have a look at the **Tune Sheet linked above** for **instrument signs**, **general directions** and **some chants**

### Silences

**Aeroplane** *See-saw arms up and down*  
The whistler stops some instruments, then see-saws their arms to swap who is and isn’t playing


### Hits
**Broccoli** *Fist over three fingers*

**Boom Break** *Hands flying away from head*

**Progressive Hits** *Fist and other hand shows 1. Show 2 etc. to build*  
Hit beat 1 when counted in. When told, build to first 2 beats, 3, 4s, 8s, 16s...


### Other short

**Tam Line:** *One hand OK sign*  
Whistler whistles the song’s tam part, everyone plays it once

**Yala Break** *Gather fingers on one hand and shake wrist*  
From the RoR tune Hafla

### Karlas
**Capped Karla** *Flat palm over Karla Break sign*


### Shouting
**Flappy Mouth** *“Talking” hand*


### Looping
**Conga** *C with whole hand*   
An alternate line for surdos that pairs with...

**Little Cat** *Conga sign with air quotes in other hand*  
An accompanying line usually used for backpack

**Kickback 1** *One thumb over shoulder*  
From the RoR tune Ragga. A great way to build up hype or do a heartbeat sound going into...

**Kickback 2** *Both thumbs over shoulders*  
The high-energy payoff. Instead of constant 16s, agogôs can play little bursts of chaos at random  
Best to use a break to get back into your main tune

**Zorro Break** *Draw a ‘Z’ in the air*  
Also from Ragga. Can be an alternate line for surdos or given to everyone to play once to get out of the Kickbacks


### Longer
**Bunny Ears** *Arms forward over your head*  
Often used to speed up or slow down a band if the song doesn’t have a call break  

**Wolf Break** *Arms “bite” with fingers as teeth*

**Hardcore Break** *Double devil horns down*  
A great way to build up the hype!
