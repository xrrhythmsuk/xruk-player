These are the rest of our general breaks.  
They don’t all have audio here, but they do all get used and are worth knowing, so dig in!


### Silences

**Aeroplane** *See-saw arms up and down*  
The whistler stops some instruments, then see-saws their arms to swap who is and isn’t playing

**Progressive Hits** *Fist and other hand shows 1. Show 2 etc. to build*
