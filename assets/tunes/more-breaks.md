These are the rest of our general breaks.

Once your band has the core tunes and core breaks down, learning more general breaks is a great next step along with looking at more individual song breaks.

These breaks don’t all have audio here, but they do all get used and are worth knowing, so dig in!

The **Tune Sheet linked above** has everything in the Core Breaks (including **instrument signs**, **general directions** and **some chants**) as well as what’s here.

### Silences

**Aeroplane** *See-saw arms up and down*  
The whistler stops some instruments, then see-saws their arms to swap who is and isn’t playing


### Hits
[**Broccoli**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Broccoli) *Fist over three fingers*

[**Boom Break**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Boom%20Break) *Hands flying away from head*  
Often just signed as *Fist and other hand shows 1*, though you’ll probably want to include a Main
afterwards so people don't think you mean...

**Progressive Hits** *Fist and other hand shows 1. Show 2 etc. or point upwards and count in to build*  
Also known as Scots Break. Hit beat 1 when counted in. When told, build to first 2 beats, 3, 4s, 8s, 16s...


### Other short

**Tam Line** *One hand OK sign*  
Whistler whistles the song’s tam part, everyone plays it once  
e.g. [Custard](/#/listen/Custard/Tam%20Line), [Afoxé](/#/listen/Afoxe/Tam%20Line)


### Karlas
[**Capped Karla**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Capped%20Karla) *Flat palm over Karla Break sign*


### Shouting
[**Flappy Mouth**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Flappy%20Mouth) *“Talking” hand*


### Looping
[**Conga**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Conga) *C with whole hand*   
An alternate line for surdos that pairs with...

[**Little Cat**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Little%20Cat) *Conga sign with air quotes in other hand*  
An accompanying line usually used for backpack  
Repis can do this or [their special part](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Little%20Cat%20(Alt%20Repi)), which snares [can incorporate](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Capped%20Karla%20(Little%20Cat)) into Capped Karla  
(It usually sounds better for snares to click their sticks together instead of doing a rim hit)

*See also:* [**Kickback 1**](/#/listen/Ragga/Kickback%201), [**Kickback 2**](/#/listen/Ragga/Kickback%202), [**Zorro Break**](/#/listen/Ragga/Zorro%20Break) from **Ragga**


### Longer
[**Bunny Ears**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Bunny%20Ears) *Arms forward over your head*  
Often used to speed up or slow down a band if the song doesn’t have a call break  

[**Wolf Break**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Wolf%20Break) *Arms “bite” with fingers as teeth*

[**Hardcore Break**](/#/listen/More%20Breaks/Hardcore%20Break) *Double devil horns down*  
A great way to build up the hype!  
There’s an [alternate RoR version](https://player.rhythms-of-resistance.org/#/listen/Special%20Breaks/Hardcore%20Break) that starts each section off doing 4s

*See also:* [**Butterfly Break**](/#/listen/Bhangra/Butterfly%20Break) from **Bhangra**, [**Circle Break**](/#/listen/Samba%20Reggae/Circle%20Break) and [**SOS Break**](/#/listen/Samba%20Reggae/SOS%20Break) from **Samba Reggae**

## Background

Most general breaks start life as part of a tune. This is often mentioned on the individual tune pages, but here’s where a lot of them come from in case it gives you some ideas:
* **Silence**, **Clave** and **Knock On The Door** are originally from **Samba Reggae**
* **Conga/Little Cat** and **Flappy Mouth** are originally from **Funk** (and before that, there was a whole set of tunes called Conga from which surdos played what became our Conga, tams played Little Cat and repis played the special alt line)
* The **Karla Break** and **Capped Karla** are indeed originally from **Karla**, where the Karla Break used to be Break 1, and so is **Progressive Hits** (though it’s also a classic samba reggae break in its own right)
* **Progressive Karla** originally comes from **Drum & Bass** (it was the Progressive Break – missing our last bar – before it got Karla-fied)
* The **Wolf Break** originally comes from **Afoxé**
* The **Whistle Break** in Samba Reggae originally comes from the RoR tune **Sheffield Samba Reggae**
* The **Tam Line** break replaces the older idea of every tune being allowed to have a short break as well as 1/2/3/Call. The Samba Reggae short break (Clave) eventually became a general break and took the old “short” sign, and other tunes’ short breaks either became Tam Lines (e.g. Afoxé, Custard) or an extra numbered break (e.g. Funk 2)


It can be helpful when playing with RoR bands to know which material we’re more likely to have in common – even if it’s often signed and played a little differently, it’s still mostly the same. Here are the things that we know *aren’t* shared with the RoR network:
* **4 Hits**, **8 Hits**, **X Break** from the **Core Breaks**
* **Broccoli**, **Capped Karla**, **Conga/Little Cat**, **Bunny Ears** from **More Breaks**
* **7 Break** and **Butterfly Break** from **Bhangra**
* **Break 1** from **Wolf** (and **Break 2** doesn’t match)
* The tunes **Stolen** and **Jericho**
