A hypnotic, surdo-led tune introduced to our network at band camp 2024. Pairs well with [Hedgehog](/#/listen/Hedgehog)!

**Sign:** fists together, thumbs out left and right

## Background

**Name:** Ragga (short for Raggamuffin) is a type of electronic Jamaican pop music based on Reggae ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragga))

**Musical background:** The snare and surdo beats can be heard in many Ragga songs

**Sign:** Based on the Kickbacks? *(More info needed.)*

**History:** A Barking Bateria tune introduced to the RoR network in 2010 or so

Our version is in some respects closer to the [original](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/ragga)

The starter agogô part is based on Break 1

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repi**: medium
* **Snare**: tricky
* **Tam**: medium
* **Agogô**: hard (medium starter part available, or loop the first bar)

## Breaks

* The Kickbacks are a great way to build energy, even in other tunes
  * [**Kickback 1**](/#/listen/Ragga/Kickback%201) *(one thumb over shoulder)* is the heartbeat-like build-up to...
  * [**Kickback 2**](/#/listen/Ragga/Kickback%202) *(both thumbs over shoulders)*, the high-energy pay-off. Just make sure the surdos don’t drag!  
    Agogôs play rolling bursts of chaos between the bells (which sadly we can’t do justice to on here), and in some bands they run around and annoy everyone too!
* Breaks 1, 2 and 3 are little one-bar riffs that are ideal for getting out of the Kickbacks
  * [**Break 1**](/#/listen/Ragga/Break%201) is a slightly trickier whistle- and surdo-led break that you can use like [Sambasso 1](/#/listen/Sambasso/Break%201), or
    do against e.g. agogôs playing the main part _\[uncommon nationally\]_
  * [**Break 2**](/#/listen/Ragga/Break%202) is the simplest as it’s everyone together. The shouted counts are a lot of fun!
  * [**Break 3**](/#/listen/Ragga/Break%203) is surdo-led and might remind some of a [90s rock song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ)... _\[less common nationally\]_
* The [**Zorro Break**](/#/listen/Ragga/Zorro%20Break) *(draw a ‘Z’ in the air)* is originally an alternate surdo line but works nicely with
  everyone doing it (including in other tunes)
