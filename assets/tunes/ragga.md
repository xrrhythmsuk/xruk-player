A hypnotic tune introduced to our network at band camp 2024 that pairs very well with Hedgehog.

More than any other of our tunes, the surdos lead and everyone else responds.

The breaks mostly carry on this idea – only Break 2 (which is everyone together) isn’t surdo-led.

**Sign:** fists together, thumbs out left and right

## Background

**Name:** Ragga (short for Raggamuffin) is a type of electronic Jamaican pop music based on Reggae. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragga))

**Musical background:** The snare and surdo beats can be heard in many Ragga songs.

**Sign:** Based on the Kickbacks? *(More info needed.)*

**History:** A Barking Bateria tune introduced to the RoR network in 2010 or so.

Our version is in some respects closer to the [original](https://soundcloud.com/barking-bateria/ragga).

The starter agogô part is based on Break 1.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repi**: medium
* **Snare**: tricky
* **Tam**: medium
* **Agogô**: hard (starter part available)

## Breaks

* The Kickbacks are the surdo-led star of the show. They’re a great way to build energy, and as they have their own signs you can use them (along with Zorro Break) in other tunes, such as Hedgehog.
  * **Kickback 1** *(one thumb over shoulder)* is the heartbeat-like build-up to...
  * **Kickback 2** *(both thumbs over shoulders)*, the high-energy pay-off. Just mind the surdos don't drag! Agogôs don’t need to play constant
    16s – instead, they can play chaos between the bells, taking little pauses wherever they feel like.
    In some bands they run around and annoy everyone too!
* Breaks 1, 2 and 3 are little one-bar riffs that are ideal for getting out of the Kickbacks
  * **Break 1** is a slightly trickier whistle- and surdo-led break that you can use like Sambasso 1, or
    leave e.g. agogôs playing and then do several times with everyone else before going back to the main part
  * **Break 2** is the simplest as it’s everyone together. The shouted counts make it a lot of fun!
  * **Break 3** is surdo-led and might remind some of a [Rage Against The Machine song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ)...
* The **Zorro Break** *(draw a ‘Z’ in the air)* is originally an alternate surdo line but works nicely with
  everyone doing it
