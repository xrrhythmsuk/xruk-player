These are our core general breaks, which have their own signs so you can use them in any song.

You can give breaks and directions to different instruments, so you can do a lot with just a few of them.

Have a look at the **Tune Sheet linked above** for **instrument signs**, **general directions** and **some chants**.

### Silences

**Silence** *Hold up 4 fingers*  
Four silent beats (1 bar)

**Silence 2x** *Hold up 8 fingers*  
Eight silent beats (2 bars)

**Silence 4x** *8 fingers pointing down*  
Sixteen silent beats (4 bars)

### Hits

**4 Hits** *Fist and 4 horizontal fingers*  
Hit four beats

**8 Hits** *Fist and 4 horizontal fingers turning*  
Hit eight beats

**Chaos Break** *Pulling your hair out*  
Play noise until signed (Don’t wait for whistle in)


### Other short

**Clave** *Finger and thumb U*  
Usually pronounced CLAH-vay

**Clave 2x** *Clave sign in each hand*  
Two bars of clave

**Clave 4x soft to loud** *Clave and 4 horizontal fingers, all rising*  
Four bars of clave going from quiet to loud. You can also do it falling to do loud to quiet

### Karlas

**Karla Break** *Thumb and two fingers*
A bar of 16s quiet, then medium, then loud, then a hit just on beat 1

**Progressive Karla** *Grab thumb of raised hand*  
A bar of 4s, then 8s, then 16s, then a hit just on beat 1

Sign either of these breaks with a short break afterwards to replace the last bar with that break   
e.g. Karla Break with clave


### Shouting

**X Break** *Crossed forearms or sticks*  
The shout is “Ex-tin-ction! Re-be-llion! ... Hey!”

**A Break** *Forearms make an upside-down V*  
The shout is ”Act now!”


### Looping

**Knock On The Door** *Knock on palm*  
This is good as a transition between songs or an alternate line for one or two instruments
