These are our **main hand signs** and **core general breaks**, which have their own signs so you can use them in any song.

As you can give breaks and directions to different instruments, you can do a lot with just a few of these breaks.

Have a look at the **Tune Sheet linked above** for **some chants** as well.

We recommend doing the signs big and over your head, leaving lots of time and space so everything’s clear to the band. (Especially for a big band – imagine you’re steering a whale!) Don’t worry if it ever doesn’t work, though, just try again or do **Chaos Break** and bring us back in!

## Instruments

**Low/mid/high surdo** *Raise fist and point to low/mid/high on forearm*

**All surdos** *Raise fist and brush up and down forearm*

&nbsp;

**Repi** *One hand devil horns*

**Snare** *Cross index fingers*

&nbsp;

**Tam** *Tap palm*

**Agogô** *Tap finger between index and thumb*

**Shaker** *Wave loaf of bread*

## General directions

**Stop** *Other hand pulls down raised fist*

**Play main part** *Hands on head in ‘M’*

&nbsp;

**Everyone (else)** *Hand does horizontal loop*

**Keep going/Repeat** *Both hands vertical loop*

**Play 1/2/3/4 times** *One finger horizontal (or sign) in one hand, 1/2/3/4 horizontal in the other*

e.g. “Surdos – Stop – Everyone (else) – Keep going/Repeat” to stop just the surdos, “Everyone (else) – Clave – Keep going/Repeat” for the whole band to play the clave in a loop

&nbsp;

**Break 1/2/3** *Show 1/2/3 fingers*

**Call Break** *Waft hands away from you*

These come from the tune the band is currently playing. Not every tune has all of them!

&nbsp;

**Faster/Slower** *Spiral hand up/down*

**Louder/Quieter** *Raise/lower flat hand (or sign)* (Don’t wait for whistle in)

**Play on rim** *Draw air circle* (Don’t wait for whistle in)

&nbsp;

**Form rows** *Draw air square* (Don’t wait for whistle in)

**Chant** *Hands waft from around mouth*

## Counting in
To **whistle in** an instruction, check everyone has seen your signs (blow the whistle while you’re signing so people know to take notice!) and then [whistle and count](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Whistle%20In) on your fingers **1, 2, 1 2 3 4** (two bars).

For bigger bands or just to be clear, [whistle and count](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Whistle%20In%20(long)) **1... 2... 1, 2, 1 2 3 4** (four bars).

It helps if your counting looks different (e.g. using a different hand) from signing Break 1/2/3!

## Core breaks
### Silences

**Silence** *Hold up 4 fingers*  
Four silent beats (1 bar)

**Silence 2x** *Hold up 8 fingers*  
Eight silent beats (2 bars)

**Silence 4x** *8 fingers pointing down*  
Sixteen silent beats (4 bars)

### Hits

[**4 Hits**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/4%20Hits) *Fist and 4 horizontal fingers*  
Hit four beats

[**8 Hits**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/8%20Hits) *Fist and 4 horizontal fingers turning*  
Hit eight beats

**Chaos Break** *Pulling your hair out* (Don’t wait for whistle in)  
Play noise until signed


### Other short

[**Clave**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Clave) *Finger and thumb U*  
Usually pronounced CLAH-vay

[**Clave 2x**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Clave%202x) *Clave sign in each hand*  
Two bars of clave

[**Clave 4x soft to loud**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Clave%204x) *Clave and 4 horizontal fingers, all rising*  
Four bars of clave going from quiet to loud. You can also do it falling to do loud to quiet

### Karlas

[**Karla Break**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Karla%20Break) *Thumb and two fingers*  
A bar of 16s quiet, then medium, then loud, then a hit just on beat 1  
Sometimes called a drum roll break, but even then usually played with 16s rather than buzzes

[**Progressive Karla**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Progressive%20Karla) *Grab thumb of raised hand*  
A bar of 4s, then 8s, then 16s, then a hit just on beat 1

If you’ve only got one stick (such as if you’re on tam or agogô), it’s usually better to play just 8s
instead of trying for lots of 16s as it’s easier to stay in time and (more importantly) means less strain

Sign either of these breaks with a short break afterwards to replace the last bar with that break   
e.g. [Karla Break with clave](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Karla%20Clave)


### Shouting

[**X Break**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/X%20Break) *Crossed forearms or sticks*  
Good to discuss ahead of time whether you’re doing this one at non-XR events

[**A Break**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/A%20Break) *Forearms make an upside-down V*  
Try changing the shout for specific actions!

*See also:* [**7 Break**](/#/listen/Bhangra/7%20Break) from **Bhangra**

### Looping

[**Knock On The Door**](/#/listen/Core%20Breaks/Knock%20On%20The%20Door) *Knock on palm*  
This is good as a transition between songs or an alternate line for one or two instruments  
Try clicking your sticks on the beat in the gaps!
