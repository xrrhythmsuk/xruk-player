A new XR Rhythms tune created so we had another one like Bhangra going:

*1-and-a, 2-and-a, 3-and-a, 4-and-a* (like a jig) instead of *1-a-and-a, 2-a-and-a, 3-a-and-a, 4-a-and-a*.

Some general breaks work best altered to divide each beat into three rather than four (e.g. Karla break, Progressive Karla).
Some work as they are, and others are best avoided. Good to experiment with!

**Sign:** palms up together facing you, then drop

## Background

**Name:** From the title of the original tune

**Musical background:** Based on the jazz swing tune “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho” by Sidney Bechet ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2l8uW3CrGQ)), which itself is based on an old African American spiritual ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Fit_the_Battle_of_Jericho)). (“Fit” here would be “fought” in Standard English.)

Some of the fun but tricky jazzy rhythms have made it over into our tune. Try listening to the original linked above for some context!

The breaks are based on different parts of the song except for Break 3, which is secretly from a different swing tune with an iconic drum hook ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9J5Zt2Obko)).

**Sign:** The walls of Jericho coming tumbling down (palms facing you to avoid confusion with 2x Silent)

**History:** Commissioned in late 2022, introduced nationally in April 2023

The original spiritual is based on a Bible story where the besieged city of Jericho’s walls miraculously collapse when the Israelites (led by Joshua) blow trumpets

## Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** medium
* **Mid/High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** hard
* **Tam:** medium
* **Agogô:** medium

## Breaks

* **Break 1** is a short one based on the end of the chorus “*... and the wall came tumbling down*”
* **Break 2** is led by tams and agogôs
* **Break 3** is led by surdos
* The **Call break** works nicely as an intro
* **General breaks** that work well: ones you’d use with Bhangra
